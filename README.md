# Real Life "Fruit" Ninja
Slash and swipe in a real, physical space for fruit ninja beyond the digital screen. Rather than fruits, however, we drop geometric shapes for your slicing pleasure.

> The detection of a "swipe", especially with your fingers, is dysfunctional. However, the basic premise is there: basic game mechanics are in place, and the user can interface with the game using only their hands. To some degree, I believe this can be accomplished with optical flow alone, without hand or finger tracking, but until I return at a later date, no way to say for certain. Cheers! Hope this helps someone out, or inspires someone to try this.

> Original goals:
> - Finish onscreen interface: build functional swipe detection, potentially using a better finger detector
> - Add projection interface: Use [camera calibration](https://github.com/alvinwan/real-life-fruit-ninja) to allow interaction with a projected game screen.
